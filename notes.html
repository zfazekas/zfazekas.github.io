<li><b>Incentives for non-participation in the United Kingdom House of Commons</b> (with Martin Ejnar Hansen)</li>

<ul style="none; padding-top: 0.25em; list-style-type: square;">
  <li>The ability to hold MPs accountable for their actions is one of the cornerstones of modern representative democracy. While it is important for MPs to send signals to both their constituents and to their party, a large number of MPs remain absent from votes. These absences are an important part of the MP's toolbox, however, their use comes with some limitations, rooted in electoral and political constraints. We investigate how-conditional on the electoral cycle-some well established political constraints along the government and opposition lines vary in strength. We analyze the absence probability of MPs in the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2015 and find that as the next elections are approaching, political constraints somewhat weaken and electoral ones take over, but there are marked differences between legislatures.</li>

<li><b>Back to School: The effects of school reopening on parents and children</b> (with Jens Olav Dahlgaard)</li>

<ul style="none; padding-top: 0.25em; list-style-type: square;">
  <li>On 15 April, over a few days, Danish schools partially reopened. Only children up until the 5th grade were allowed to return to school. We present results from a two-wave panel survey collected for parents with children in the 4th to the 7th grade in the week that schools partially reopened (Wave 1, initial N = 1,303) and again two weeks after (Wave 2, initial N = 1,000 reinterviewed). Using a difference-in-difference analysis, we compare parents with children below and above the cut-off. We do not find major differences in how our outcomes of interest develop. Government support decreased slightly more for parents whose children stayed at home, but child well-being, parental stress, economic situation mostly evolved in parallel for the two groups of families. In the context of a high compliance lockdown and in the short run, the gradual reopening did not lead to major differences in parental stress, child well-being, or economic situation, but resulted in some difference in government support. More research is warranted on the longer term effects of school lockdowns and reopenings under different social contexts. </li>

<li><b>Exclusionary media populism in tabloids and broadsheets</b> (with Stefanie Walter)</li>

<ul style="none; padding-top: 0.25em; list-style-type: square;">
  <li>The news media play a crucial role for the dissemination of populist messages. This study focuses on exclusionary media populism and argues that it can be linked to systematic differences in the portrayal of different groups of citizens to generate an in- and outgroup divide. Analyzing the Brexit-related news coverage using word embeddings, we first document the presence of media populism in the form of homogeneous migrant and EU citizen representations as outgroups portrayed very dissimilar to the U.K. citizens ingroup. In line with previous research, our findings show a convergence between tabloid and broadsheet news, as differences in the degree of exclusionary media populism are negligible.</li>

<li><b>Raising moral considerations in the European Court of Human Rights</b> (with Øyvind Stiansen)</li>
<ul style="none; padding-top: 0.25em; list-style-type: square;">
  <li>Judges at international courts frequently use language strategically. Extant scholarship has focused on the rhetorical strategies court employ to persuade external audiences. For international courts that develop precedents and face internal disagreements internally, judges also face incentives to use language strategically to influence the development of case law. We argue that judges invoke moral considerations in dissenting and concurring opinions to persuade future panels to depart from established case law. We evaluate our argument using quantitative text analysis on more than 10 000 majority rulings and 3000 individual opinions from the European Court of Human Rights. We show that judges rely more on moral rhetoric when their disagreement with the majority ruling increases. Moreover, this strategy is effective in reducing future panels' reliance on the majority ruling in future decision making. </li>
