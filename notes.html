<li><b>Similar citizen portrayals? Converging exclusionary media populism in tabloids and broadsheets</b> (with Stefanie Walter)</li>

<ul style="none; padding-top: 0.25em; list-style-type: square;">
  <li>Political communication researchers studying the news media coverage often distinguishes between broadsheets and tabloids when sampling relevant news outlets. But recent work has pointed towards a ‘tabloidization’ of news coverage, complicating the empirical distinction between the two. Computational methods for text analysis can help us better understand how distinct the news coverage between these two types of news outlets is. We take the Brexit referendum as a case study illustrating various aspects in which broadsheets and tabloids cover an issue permeated by populist and divisive rhetoric. We focus on Brexit-related news coverage before and after the referendum (N=32,946) and use word embeddings to analyze the portrayal of different groups of citizens that can generate an in- and outgroup divide. First, we document the presence of exclusionary media populism in the form of overly similar migrant and European Union citizen representations that are, in turn, very dissimilar to the U.K. citizen representation. Second, we show convergence between tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, as differences in the degree and characteristics of media coverage are negligible.</li>

<li><b>Raising moral considerations in the European Court of Human Rights</b> (with Øyvind Stiansen)</li>
<ul style="none; padding-top: 0.25em; list-style-type: square;">
  <li>Judges frequently use language strategically. Extant scholarship has focused on the rhetorical strategies courts employ to persuade external audiences. For courts that develop precedents and face internal disagreements internally, judges also face incentives to use language strategically to influence the development of case law. We argue that judges invoke moral considerations in dissenting and concurring opinions to persuade future panels to depart from established case law. We evaluate our argument using quantitative text analysis on more than 10,000 majority rulings and 3,000 individual opinions from the European Court of Human Rights. First, we show that judges rely more on moral rhetoric when their disagreement with the majority ruling increases. Second, we find evidence for this strategic use of language being effective it reduces future panels' reliance on the majority ruling in future decision making. In addition, this strategic use of moral language is more successful than simply relying on valence or emotional considerations.</li>
