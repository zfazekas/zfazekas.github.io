<h1>Two weeks later: The effects of school re-opening on families’ health, emotional well-being, government support, and economic situation</h1>

<p>We present results from two waves of a panel-survey collected for parents with children in the 4th to the 7th grade in the week that schools partially re-opened (Wave 1, initial N = 1,303) and again two weeks after (Wave 2, initial N = 1,000 re-interviewed). On April 15, over a few days, schools partially re-opened after having been closed for an entire month. Only children up until the 5th grade were allowed to return to school. In this report, we explore how the well-being of parents, their suspicion of infection, their assessment of their children's well-being, their support for the authorities, and their economic situation has developed since the gradual reopening.

<p>You can find our detailed report <a href = "https://www.cbs.dk/files/cbs.dk/back_2_school-extended.pdf", target="_blank">here</a>. Our findings are as follows:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Comparing two weeks after the re-opening (wave 2) to the re-opening, we find that this group of parents has experienced a decline in infection suspicion, stress, support for the Prime Minister and the Health Authorities, and they were be better able to take care of their work obligations. We find a small decrease in children's well-being (assessed by parents).</li>
<li>There has been much debate about the choice that only some children were allowed to go back to school, while others were not. When we compare parents with children in 4th or 5th grade to parents of children in 6th or 7th grade, we do not find major differences in how our outcomes of interest develop.</li>
<li>Around the re-opening, parents of the older children group (6th or 7th grade) showed the most support for the Prime Minister and the Health Authorities. Since then, there has been a significant decline for those parents whose children had to stay home.</li>
<li>We do not find that parents rate child well-being better or worse among children who have returned to school compared to children who did not, but as highlighted above, there is a small, overall decrease in well-being.</li>
</ul>
