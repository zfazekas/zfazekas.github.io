<h2>Incentives for non-participation: Absence in the United Kingdom House of Commons, 1997-2015</h2>

<p>The ability to hold MPs accountable for their actions is one of the cornerstones of modern representative democracy. While it is important for MPs to send signals to both their constituents and to their party, a large number of MPs remain absent from votes. These absences are an important part of the MP's toolbox, however, their use comes with some limitations, rooted in electoral and political constraints. We argue that conditional on the electoral cycle, some well established political constraints along the government and opposition lines will vary in strength and influence the potential use of absence. We analyze the absence probability of MPs in the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2015 and find that as the next elections are approaching, political constraints weaken and electoral ones take over. This is reflected by converging absences between opposition and government MPs, however there are between legislature differences in how this unfolds.</p>
